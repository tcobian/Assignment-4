##1. Lobster abundance and fishing pressure
```{r}
#basic data wrangling
#took out the -99999 values out of lobster_size_abundance under size because this means it was not recorded
#chnaged numeric month (i.e 8=Aug) to three letter month abbreviation
#change numerical months in "lobster_traps" to three letter abbreviation
lobster_1<- lobster_size_abundance %>% 
  filter(SIZE != -99999) 
  
lobster_1$MONTH<- (month.abb[lobster_1$MONTH])

lobster_traps$MONTH<- (month.abb[lobster_traps$MONTH])
```


```{r}
#exploratory graphs relating size and count to site and date/ year
#Considering changing names of months and sites
ggplot(lobster_1, aes(x = SITE, y = COUNT ))+
  geom_point(color = "blue")

ggplot(lobster_1, aes(x = MONTH, y = COUNT ))+
  geom_col()

ggplot(lobster_1, aes(x = SITE, y = COUNT))+

ggplot(lobster_1, aes(x = SITE, y = SIZE))+
