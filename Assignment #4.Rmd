#read in tidyverse and knitr packeges (what other packages do you think we will need?)

```

##1. Lobster abundance and fishing pressure
```{r}
#basic data wrangling
lobster_traps_1<-lobster_traps %>% 
  select(YEAR,SITE,TRAPS) %>% 
  filter(SITE == "AQUE" | SITE == "CARP" | SITE == "IVEE" | SITE == "MOHK" | SITE == "NAPL")

#just keep Year Site and Trap data

lobster_1<- lobster_size_abundance %>% 
  filter(SIZE != -99999) %>% 
  select(SITE,YEAR,MONTH,SIZE,COUNT) 
#took out the -99999 values out of lobster_size_abundance under size because this means it was not recorded
#Only kept Year, Month, Size and Count data
  
lobster_1$MONTH<- (month.abb[lobster_1$MONTH])
#change numerical months in "lobster_1" to three letter abbreviation

lobster_traps$MONTH<- (month.abb[lobster_traps$MONTH])
#change numerical months in "lobster_traps" to three letter abbreviation
```


```{r}
#graph for each site relating count to year
abundance_graph<-ggplot(lobster_1, aes(x = YEAR, y = COUNT))+
  geom_point(aes(color = COUNT), show.legend = "false", alpha = 0.5)+
  facet_wrap(~SITE, scales = "free")+
  scale_y_continuous(name = "number of lobsters", limits = c(0,25))+
  theme_classic()
abundance_graph
ggplotly(abundance_graph)


#graph relating fishing pressure (number of traps) for each site by year

pressure_graph<- ggplot(lobster_traps_1, aes(x = YEAR, y = TRAPS))+
  geom_point(aes(color = TRAPS), show.legend = "false", alpha = 0.5)+
  facet_wrap(~SITE, scales = "free")+
  scale_y_continuous(name = "number of traps", limits = c(0,25))+
  theme_classic()

2. Compare mean lobster size by site in 2017

```{r}
#Use lobster_1 df for mean size data
# Use and ANOVA
# maybe a posthoc test

lobster_2<- lobster_1 %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>%
  expand.dft(freq = "COUNT") 

lobster_2

variance<- lobster_2 %>% 
  group_by(SITE) %>% 
  summarize(variance = var(SIZE))
variance

#This shows that the lowest variance is less than 4  times smaller than the largest variance, so we can use a one way ANOVA

#Do an Levene test to see if variances are equal
lobster_levene<- leveneTest(SIZE ~ SITE, data = lobster_2)
lobster_levene

#The variances are not equal

# Run ANOVA to see if means are equal

lobster_ANOVA<- aov(SITE ~ SIZE, data = lobster_2) 

#table with the results of  ANOVA

summary(lobster_ANOVA)

# reject null hypothesis, at least two samples are from sites with different means

# Use Tukeyhsd to find out which means are different

lobster_hsd<- TukeyHSD(lobster_ANOVA)
lobster_hsd

# CARP and AQUE are not different
# IVEE and AQUE are not different
# IVEE and CARP are not different

# create a graphic to show differences in means

#finding sd to put in error bars in graph
site_summary<- lobster_2 %>% 
  group_by(SITE) %>% 
  summarize(sd = sd(SIZE),
            mean = mean(SIZE))
site_summary

lobster_bar<- ggplot(site_summary, aes(x = SITE, y = mean))+
  geom_col()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean-sd, ymax = mean+sd))
lobster_bar
# ask in office hours why ANOVA and Tukey says means are different but graph of means by site looks similar

```


3. Changes in lobster size at MPA and non MPA sites (comparing only 2012 and 2017 sizes)

```{r}
# create a data fram for only 2012 ann 2017
lobster_3<- lobster_2 %>% 
  filter(YEAR == 2012 | YEAR == 2017)
lobster_3

mpa<- lobster_3 %>% 
  filter(SITE == "IVEE" | SITE == "NAPL")

mpa_IVEE<- mpa %>% 
  filter(SITE == "IVEE") %>% 
  spread(SIZE,YEAR)
mpa_IVEE


# I was able to perform a t.test for the two mpa sites between year 2012 and 2017, I dont know if this is what we need Gage had said something about doing 5 seperate t.tests for each site between the two years

mpa_testt<- mpa %>% 
  t.test(SIZE~YEAR, data = . , var.equal = TRUE)
mpa_testt

# p-value = 0.056 so means do not differ significantly between the two years.

```


4. Proportions of "legal" lobsters at the 5 sites in 2017

```{r}
lobster_4<- lobster_2 %>% 
  count(SITE,SIZE) %>% 
  spread(SIZE,n)
# we need to try and make a df that has eaxh site and the amount of lobsters above and below th elegal limit

legal_counts<- lobster_2 %>% 
  mutate(legal = case_when(SIZE>=82.6 ~ "yes", SIZE<82.6 ~ "no")) %>% 
  count(SITE,legal) %>% 
  spread(legal,n) %>% 
  select(-SITE)
rownames(legal_counts)<-c("AQUE","CARP","IVEE","MOHK","NAPL")
legal_counts

#make a kable table for the legal_counts data

legal_counts_table<-kable(legal_counts,
      caption = "Amount of lobsters over legal size 82.6mm at each site") %>% 
  kable_styling(c("striped", "border"))
legal_counts_table
# perform a chi-square to test for independance

legal_prop<- prop.table(as.matrix(legal_counts), 1)
legal_prop

legal_prop_table<- kable(legal_prop, 
                         caption = "Proportion of lobsters that are over legal size at each site") %>% 
  kable_styling(c("striped", "border"))
legal_prop_table


# perform a chi-square to see if there is an association between site and size of lobster
# results tell us there is p - value is close to zero
lobster_x2<- chisq.test(legal_counts)
lobster_x2
